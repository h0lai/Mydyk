Upon launching, you'll encounter a user-friendly GUI with various input fields and options. Here's a breakdown to guide you through:

    Set Profile Name: Enter a name for your recoil settings.
    Horizontal Parameter: Minus values (-1 - -10) = left movements. positive values (1 - 10) = right movements.
    Vertical Parameter: Similarly, this adjusts the vertical recoil control. Minus values for inverted Y Axis.
    Game Process: Type in the game's executable (or any executable) name (like game.exe). Mydyk will specifically target this game for recoil control.
    On/Off - Disable/Enable Recoil toggle.
    Set UDP Flood Key - Activate and Deactivate UDP Flood.

    Save, Delete and Select Profiles.
    
üïπÔ∏è How to Use

After setting your preferences:

Launch Your Game: Ensure the game specified in the "Game Process" field is running.

Play as Usual: Once in-game, Mydyk will automatically manage the recoil based on your specified parameters whenever you press and hold the left mouse button (LButton).

Tip: Mydyk is designed to operate only when the game (specified in "Game Process") is in focus, preventing any unintentional mouse movements outside the game. 

Note: If you play inverted use Minus values for Vertical Parameter.

Use the UDP flood feature responsibly.
